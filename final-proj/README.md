To compile my written report:

```
pdflatex main.tex
biber main
pdflatex main.tex
pdflatex main.tex
```

To compile my presentation:

```
pdflatex presentation.tex
biber presentation
pdflatex presentation.tex
pdflatex presentation.tex
```

Alternatively, upload all four files to Overleaf and compilation should be handled automatically just fine.
